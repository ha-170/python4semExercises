    "### Ex 1 Classes\n",
    "1. Create 3 classes: Student, DataSheet and Course\n",
    "2. A student has a data_sheet and a data_sheet has multiple courses in particular order\n",
    "3. Each course has name, classroom, teacher, ETCS and optional grade if course is taken.\n",
    "4. In Student create __init__() so that a Student can be initiated with name, gender, data_sheet and image_url\n",
    "5. In DataSheet create a method to get_grades_as_list()\n",
    "6. In student create a method: get_avg_grade()\n",
    "7. Create a function that can generate n number of students with random: name, gender, courses (from a fixed list of course names), grades, img_url\n",
    "   1. Let the function write the result to a csv file with format stud_name, course_name, teacher, ects, classroom, grade, img_url\n",
    "7. Read student data into a list of Students from a csv file: \n",
    "   1. loop through the list and print each student with name, img_url and avg_grade.\n",
    "   2. sort the list by avg_grade\n",
    "   3. create a bar chart with student_name on x and avg_grade on y-axis\n",
    "8. Make a method on Student class that can show progression of the study in % (add up ECTS from all passed courses divided by total of 150 total points (equivalent to 5 semesters))\n",
    "9. Show a bar chart of distribution of study progression on x-axis and number of students in each category on y-axis. (e.g. make 10 categories from 0-100%)\n",
    "\n",
    "Extra: Make the Datasheet class iterable so that next(data_sheet) will return the next course in the list\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ex 2 Exceptions (extra)\n",
    "1. Create a function that can take a list of students and return the 3 students closest to completing their study.\n",
    "2. If list is shorter than 3 raise your own custom exception (NotEnoughStudentsException)\n",
    "3. Create another function that can create a csv file with 3 students closest to completion\n",
    "   1. If an exception is raised write an appropriate message to the file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ex 3 Plotting (extra)\n",
    "1. Create a function that can take a list of students and show a pie chart of how students are distributed in ECTS percentage categories (10%, 20%, ...)\n",
    "2. create a function that can take a list of students and show how many students have taken each course (bar chart)\n",
    "   1. create a method on student that can return a list of courses\n",
    "3. make the figure show males and females in different colors for each course (display 2 datasets in same figure)\n"
